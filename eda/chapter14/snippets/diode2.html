    <p>The junction diode is the basic semiconductor device and the simplest one modeled in ngspice, but itâ€™s model is quite complex, even if not all the physical phenomena affecting a pn junction are modeled. The diode is modeled in three different regions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Forward bias: the anode is more positive than the cathode, the diode is "on" and can conduct large currents. To avoid convergence problems and unrealistic high current, it is better to specify a series resistance to limit current with rs model
            parameter.
        </li>
        <li>Reverse bias: the cathode is more positive than the anode and the diode is "off". A reverse bias diode conducts a small leakage current.</li>
        <li>Breakdown: the breakdown region is model led only if the bv model parameter is given. When a diode enters breakdown the current increase exponentially (remember to limit it); bv is a positive value.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Parameters Scaling</h3>
    <p>Model parameters are scaled using the unit-less parameters area and pj and the multiplier m as depicted below:</p>
    <p>
        \begin{align} AREA_{eff} &= AREA \cdot M \end{align}
    </p>
