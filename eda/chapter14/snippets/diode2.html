    <p>The junction diode is the basic semiconductor device and the simplest one modeled in ngspice, but itâ€™s model is quite complex, even if not all the physical phenomena affecting a pn junction are modeled. The diode is modeled in three different regions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Forward bias: the anode is more positive than the cathode, the diode is "on" and can conduct large currents. To avoid convergence problems and unrealistic high current, it is better to specify a series resistance to limit current with rs model
            parameter.
        </li>
        <li>Reverse bias: the cathode is more positive than the anode and the diode is "off". A reverse bias diode conducts a small leakage current.</li>
        <li>Breakdown: the breakdown region is model led only if the bv model parameter is given. When a diode enters breakdown the current increase exponentially (remember to limit it); bv is a positive value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Parameters Scaling</h3>
    <p>Model parameters are scaled using the unit-less parameters area and pj and the multiplier m as depicted below:</p>
    <i>
    \begin{align} 
        AREA_{eff} &= AREA \cdot M  \\
        PJ_{eff} &=PJ \cdot M \\
        IS_{eff} &=IS \cdot AREA_{eff}+JSW \cdot PJ_{eff} \\
        IBV_{eff} &=IBV \cdot AREA+{eff} \\
        IK_{eff} &=IK \cdot AREA_{eff} \\
        IKR_{eff} &=IKR \cdot AREA_{eff} \\
        CJ_{eff} &=CJ0 \cdot AREA_{eff} \\
        CJP_{eff} &=CJP \cdot PJ_{eff}
    \end{align}
