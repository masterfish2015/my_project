    <h1>What’s New in Python 2.1</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This article explains the new features in Python 2.1.  While there aren’t as
    many changes in 2.1 as there were in Python 2.0, there are still some pleasant
    surprises in store.  2.1 is the first release to be steered through the use of
    <b>Python Enhancement Proposals, or PEPs</b>, so most of the sizable changes have
    accompanying PEPs that provide more complete documentation and a design
    rationale for the change.  This article doesn’t attempt to document the new
    features completely, but simply provides an overview of the new features for
    Python programmers. Refer to the Python 2.1 documentation, or to the specific
    PEP, for more details about any new feature that particularly interests you.</p>

    <p>One recent goal of the Python development team has been to accelerate the pace
    of new releases, with a new release coming every 6 to 9 months. 2.1 is the first
    release to come out at this faster pace, with the first alpha appearing in
    January, 3 months after the final version of 2.0 was released.</p>

    <p>The final release of Python 2.1 was made on April 17, 2001.</p>
    
    <h2>PEP 227: Nested Scopes</h2>
    <p>The largest change in Python 2.1 is to Python’s scoping rules.  In Python 2.0,
    at any given time there are at most three namespaces used to look up variable
    names: local, module-level, and the built-in namespace.  This often surprised
    people because it didn’t match their intuitive expectations.  For example, a
    nested recursive function definition doesn’t work:</p>
    <pre><code class="python">def f():
    ...
    def g(value):
        ...
        return g(value-1) + 1
    ...</code></pre>

    <p>The function <code>g()</code> will always raise a <code>NameError</code> exception, because
    the binding of the name <code >g</code> isn’t in either its local namespace or in the
    module-level namespace.  This isn’t much of a problem in practice (how often do
    you recursively define interior functions like this?), but this also made using
    the <code >lambda</code> statement clumsier, and this was a problem in practice.
    In code which uses <code >lambda</code> you can often find local variables being
    copied by passing them as the default values of arguments.</p>

    <pre><code class="python">def find(self, name):
    "Return list of any entries equal to 'name'"
    L = filter(lambda x, name=name: x == name,
               self.list_attribute)
    return L</code></pre>

    <p>The readability of Python code written in a strongly functional style suffers
    greatly as a result.</p>

    <p>The most significant change to Python 2.1 is that static scoping has been added
    to the language to fix this problem.  As a first effect, the <code >name=name</code>
    default argument is now unnecessary in the above example.  Put simply, when a
    given variable name is not assigned a value within a function (by an assignment,
    or the <code >def</code>, <code >class</code>, or <code>import</code> statements),
    references to the variable will be looked up in the local namespace of the
    enclosing scope.  A more detailed explanation of the rules, and a dissection of
    the implementation, can be found in the PEP.</p>

    <p>This change may cause some compatibility problems for code where the same
    variable name is used both at the module level and as a local variable within a
    function that contains further function definitions. This seems rather unlikely
    though, since such code would have been pretty confusing to read in the first
    place.</p>

    <p>One side effect of the change is that the <code >from module import * </code> and
     <code >exec</code> statements have been made illegal inside a function scope under
    certain conditions.  The Python reference manual has said all along that <code >from module import * </code> is only legal at the top level of a module, but the CPython
    interpreter has never enforced this before.  As part of the implementation of
    nested scopes, the compiler which turns Python source into bytecodes has to
    generate different code to access variables in a containing scope.  <code>from module import *</code> and <code>exec</code> make it impossible for the compiler to
    figure this out, because they add names to the local namespace that are
    unknowable at compile time. Therefore, if a function contains function
    definitions or <code >lambda</code> expressions with free variables, the compiler
    will flag this by raising a <code >SyntaxError</code> exception.</p>

    <p>To make the preceding explanation a bit clearer, here’s an example:</p>

    <pre><code class="python">x = 1
def f():
    # The next line is a syntax error
    exec 'x=2'
    def g():
        return x</code></pre>

    <p>Line 4 containing the <code>exec</code> statement is a syntax error, since
    <code>exec</code> would define a new local variable named <code>x</code> whose value should
    be accessed by <code>g()</code>.</p>

    <p>This shouldn’t be much of a limitation, since <code>exec</code> is rarely used in
    most Python code (and when it is used, it’s often a sign of a poor design
    anyway).</p>

    <p>Compatibility concerns have led to nested scopes being introduced gradually; in
    Python 2.1, they aren’t enabled by default, but can be turned on within a module
    by using a future statement as described in PEP 236.  (See the following section
    for further discussion of PEP 236.)  In Python 2.2, nested scopes will become
    the default and there will be no way to turn them off, but users will have had
    all of 2.1’s lifetime to fix any breakage resulting from their introduction.</p>

    <h2>PEP 236: __future__ Directives</h2>
    <p>The reaction to nested scopes was widespread concern about the dangers of
    breaking code with the 2.1 release, and it was strong enough to make the
    Pythoneers take a more conservative approach.  This approach consists of
    introducing a convention for enabling optional functionality in release N that
    will become compulsory in release N+1.</p>
    
    <p>The syntax uses a <code>from...import</code> statement using the reserved module name
    <code>__future__</code>.  Nested scopes can be enabled by the following statement:</p>
    <pre><code class="python">from __future__ import nested_scopes</code></pre>
    <p>While it looks like a normal <code >import</code> statement, it’s not; there are
    strict rules on where such a future statement can be put. They can only be at
    the top of a module, and must precede any Python code or regular <code >import</code> statements.  This is because such statements can affect how
    the Python bytecode compiler parses code and generates bytecode, so they must
    precede any statement that will result in bytecodes being produced.</p>

    <h2>PEP 207: Rich Comparisons<a class="headerlink" href="#pep-207-rich-comparisons" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
    <p>In earlier versions, Python’s support for implementing comparisons on user-defined
    classes and extension types was quite simple. Classes could implement a
    <a class="reference internal" href="../reference/datamodel.html#object.__cmp__" title="object.__cmp__"><code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">__cmp__()</span></code></a> method that was given two instances of a class, and could only
    return 0 if they were equal or +1 or -1 if they weren’t; the method couldn’t
    raise an exception or return anything other than a Boolean value.  Users of
    Numeric Python often found this model too weak and restrictive, because in the
    <b>number-crunching</b> (<q>mathematical work performed by people or computers that is often quite simple but takes a long time, （简单但费时的）捣弄数字；进行运算</q>) programs that numeric Python is used for, it would be more
    useful to be able to perform elementwise comparisons of two matrices, returning
    a matrix containing the results of a given comparison for each element.  If the
    two matrices are of different sizes, then the compare has to be able to raise an
    exception to signal the error.</p>
    <p>In Python 2.1, rich comparisons were added in order to support this need.
    Python classes can now individually overload each of the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;=</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;</span></code>,

    <p>(The magic methods are named after the corresponding Fortran operators <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.LT.</span></code>.
    <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.LE.</span></code>, &amp;c.  Numeric programmers are almost certainly quite familiar with
    these names and will find them easy to remember.)</p>
    <p>Each of these magic methods is of the form <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">method(self,</span> <span class="pre">other)</span></code>, where
    <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">self</span></code> will be the object on the left-hand side of the operator, while
    <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">other</span></code> will be the object on the right-hand side.  For example, the
    expression <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span> <span class="pre">&lt;</span> <span class="pre">B</span></code> will cause <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A.__lt__(B)</span></code> to be called.</p>
    <p>Each of these magic methods can return anything at all: a Boolean, a matrix, a
    list, or any other Python object.  Alternatively they can raise an exception if
    the comparison is impossible, inconsistent, or otherwise meaningless.</p>
    <p>The built-in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cmp(A,B)</span></code> function can use the rich comparison machinery,
    and now accepts an optional argument specifying which comparison operation to
    use; this is given as one of the strings <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;&lt;=&quot;</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;&gt;=&quot;</span></code>,
    <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;==&quot;</span></code>, or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;!=&quot;</span></code>.  If called without the optional third argument,
    <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#cmp" title="cmp"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">cmp()</span></code></a> will only return -1, 0, or +1 as in previous versions of Python;
    otherwise it will call the appropriate method and can return any Python object.</p>
    <p>There are also corresponding changes of interest to C programmers; there’s a new
    slot <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tp_richcmp</span></code> in type objects and an API for performing a given rich
    comparison.  I won’t cover the C API here, but will refer you to PEP 207, or to
    2.1’s C API documentation, for the full list of related functions.</p>

    <div class="section" id="pep-230-warning-framework">
    <h2>PEP 230: Warning Framework<a class="headerlink" href="#pep-230-warning-framework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
    <p>Over its 10 years of existence, Python has accumulated a certain number of
    obsolete modules and features along the way.  It’s difficult to know when a
    feature is safe to remove, since there’s no way of knowing how much code uses it
    — perhaps no programs depend on the feature, or perhaps many do.  To enable
    removing old features in a more structured way, a warning framework was added.
    When the Python developers want to get rid of a feature, it will first trigger a
    warning in the next version of Python.  The following Python version can then
    drop the feature, and users will have had a full release cycle to remove uses of
    the old feature.</p>
    <p>Python 2.1 adds the warning framework to be used in this scheme.  It adds a
    <a class="reference internal" href="../library/warnings.html#module-warnings" title="warnings: Issue warning messages and control their disposition."><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">warnings</span></code></a> module that provide functions to issue warnings, and to filter
    out warnings that you don’t want to be displayed. Third-party modules can also
    use this framework to deprecate old features that they no longer wish to
    support.</p>
    <p>For example, in Python 2.1 the <code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">regex</span></code> module is deprecated, so importing
    it causes a warning to be printed:</p>
    <pre><code class="python">>>> import regex
__main__:1: DeprecationWarning: the regex module
            is deprecated; please use the re module
>>></code></pre>

    <p>Warnings can be issued by calling the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/warnings.html#warnings.warn" title="warnings.warn"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">warnings.warn()</span></code></a> function:</p>

    <pre><code class="python">warnings.warn("feature X no longer supported")</code></pre>

    <p>The first parameter is the warning message; an additional optional parameters
    can be used to specify a particular warning category.</p>

    <p>Filters can be added to disable certain warnings; a regular expression pattern
    can be applied to the message or to the module name in order to suppress a
    warning.  For example, you may have a program that uses the <code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">regex</span></code> module
    and not want to spare the time to convert it to use the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/re.html#module-re" title="re: Regular expression operations."><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">re</span></code></a> module right
    now.  The warning can be suppressed by calling</p>

    <pre><code class="python">import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings(action = 'ignore',
                        message='.*regex module is deprecated',
                        category=DeprecationWarning,
                        module = '__main__')</code></pre>

    <p>This adds a filter that will apply only to warnings of the class
    <code class="xref py py-class docutils literal"><span class="pre">DeprecationWarning</span></code> triggered in the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/__main__.html#module-__main__" title="__main__: The environment where the top-level script is run."><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">__main__</span></code></a> module, and applies
    a regular expression to only match the message about the <code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">regex</span></code> module
    being deprecated, and will cause such warnings to be ignored.  Warnings can also
    be printed only once, printed every time the offending code is executed, or
    turned into exceptions that will cause the program to stop (unless the
    exceptions are caught in the usual way, of course).</p>
    <p>Functions were also added to Python’s C API for issuing warnings; refer to PEP
    230 or to Python’s API documentation for the details.</p>

    <h2>PEP 229: New Build System<a class="headerlink" href="#pep-229-new-build-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
    <p>When compiling Python, the user had to go in and edit the <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">Modules/Setup</span></code>
    file in order to enable various additional modules; the default set is
    relatively small and limited to modules that compile on most Unix platforms.
    This means that on Unix platforms with many more features, most notably Linux,
    Python installations often don’t contain all useful modules they could.</p>

    <p>Python 2.0 added the Distutils, a set of modules for distributing and installing
    extensions.  In Python 2.1, the Distutils are used to compile much of the
    standard library of extension modules, autodetecting which ones are supported on
    the current machine.  It’s hoped that this will make Python installations easier
    and more featureful.</p>

    <p>Instead of having to edit the <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">Modules/Setup</span></code> file in order to enable
    modules, a <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">setup.py</span></code> script in the top directory of the Python source
    distribution is run at build time, and attempts to discover which modules can be
    enabled by examining the modules and header files on the system.  If a module is
    configured in <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">Modules/Setup</span></code>, the <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">setup.py</span></code> script won’t attempt
    to compile that module and will defer to the <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">Modules/Setup</span></code> file’s
    contents.  This provides a way to specific any strange command-line flags or
    libraries that are required for a specific platform.</p>

    <p>In another far-reaching change to the build mechanism, Neil Schemenauer
    restructured things so Python now uses a single makefile that isn’t recursive,
    instead of makefiles in the top directory and in each of the <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">Python/</span></code>,
    <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">Parser/</span></code>, <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">Objects/</span></code>, and <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">Modules/</span></code> subdirectories.  This
    makes building Python faster and also makes hacking the Makefiles clearer and
    simpler.</p>

    <p>Weak references, available through the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/weakref.html#module-weakref" title="weakref: Support for weak references and weak dictionaries."><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">weakref</span></code></a> module, are a minor but
    useful new data type in the Python programmer’s toolbox.</p>
    <p>Storing a reference to an object (say, in a dictionary or a list) has the side
    effect of keeping that object alive forever.  There are a few specific cases
    where this behaviour is undesirable, object caches being the most common one,
    and another being circular references in data structures such as trees.</p>
    <p>For example, consider a memoizing function that caches the results of another
    function <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f(x)</span></code> by storing the function’s argument and its result in a
    dictionary:</p>
    <pre><code class="python">_cache = {}
def memoize(x):
    if _cache.has_key(x):
        return _cache[x]

    retval = f(x)

    # Cache the returned object
    _cache[x] = retval

    return retval</code></pre>

    <p>This version works for simple things such as integers, but it has a side effect;
    the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_cache</span></code> dictionary holds a reference to the return values, so they’ll
    never be deallocated until the Python process exits and cleans up This isn’t
    very noticeable for integers, but if <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">f()</span></code> returns an object, or a data
    structure that takes up a lot of memory, this can be a problem.</p>
    <p>Weak references provide a way to implement a cache that won’t keep objects alive
    beyond their time.  If an object is only accessible through weak references, the
    object will be deallocated and the weak references will now indicate that the
    object it referred to no longer exists.  A weak reference to an object <em>obj</em> is
    created by calling <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wr</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">weakref.ref(obj)</span></code>.  The object being referred to is
    returned by calling the weak reference as if it were a function: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wr()</span></code>.  It
    will return the referenced object, or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">None</span></code> if the object no longer exists.</p>
    <p>This makes it possible to write a <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">memoize()</span></code> function whose cache doesn’t
    keep objects alive, by storing weak references in the cache.</p>
    
    <pre><code class="python">_cache = {}
def memoize(x):
    if _cache.has_key(x):
        obj = _cache[x]()
        # If weak reference object still exists,
        # return it
        if obj is not None: return obj

    retval = f(x)

    # Cache a weak reference
    _cache[x] = weakref.ref(retval)

    weak references — an object referenced only by proxy objects is deallocated –
    but instead of requiring an explicit call to retrieve the object, the proxy
    transparently forwards all operations to the object as long as the object still
    exists.  If the object is deallocated, attempting to use a proxy will cause a
    <a class="reference internal" href="../library/weakref.html#weakref.ReferenceError" title="weakref.ReferenceError"><code class="xref py py-exc docutils literal"><span class="pre">weakref.ReferenceError</span></code></a> exception to be raised.</p>

    <h2>PEP 232: Function Attributes<a class="headerlink" href="#pep-232-function-attributes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
    <p>In Python 2.1, functions can now have arbitrary information attached to them.
    People were often using docstrings to hold information about functions and
    methods, because the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__doc__</span></code> attribute was the only way of attaching any
    information to a function.  For example, in the Zope Web application server,
    functions are marked as safe for public access by having a docstring, and in
    John Aycock’s SPARK parsing framework, docstrings hold parts of the BNF grammar
    to be parsed.  This overloading is unfortunate, since docstrings are really
    intended to hold a function’s documentation; for example, it means you can’t
    properly document functions intended for private use in Zope.</p>

    <p>Arbitrary attributes can now be set and retrieved on functions using the regular
    Python syntax:</p>

    <pre><code class="python">def f(): pass

f.publish = 1
f.secure = 1
f.grammar = "A ::= B (C D)*"</code></pre>

    <p>The dictionary containing attributes can be accessed as the function’s
    <a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#object.__dict__" title="object.__dict__"><code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">__dict__</span></code></a>. Unlike the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#object.__dict__" title="object.__dict__"><code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">__dict__</span></code></a> attribute of class instances, in
    functions you can actually assign a new dictionary to <a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#object.__dict__" title="object.__dict__"><code class="xref py py-attr docutils literal"><span class="pre">__dict__</span></code></a>, though
    the new value is restricted to a regular Python dictionary; you <em>can’t</em> be

    <p>How numeric <b>coercion</b> (强制，强迫；威逼，胁迫) is done at the C level was significantly modified.  This
    will only affect the authors of C extensions to Python, allowing them more
    flexibility in writing extension types that support numeric operations.</p>
    <p>Extension types can now set the type flag <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Py_TPFLAGS_CHECKTYPES</span></code> in their
    <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PyTypeObject</span></code> structure to indicate that they support the new coercion model.
    In such extension types, the numeric slot functions can no longer assume that
    they’ll be passed two arguments of the same type; instead they may be passed two
    arguments of differing types, and can then perform their own internal coercion.
    If the slot function is passed a type it can’t handle, it can indicate the
    failure by returning a reference to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Py_NotImplemented</span></code> singleton value.
    The numeric functions of the other type will then be tried, and perhaps they can

    <h2>PEP 241: Metadata in Python Packages<a class="headerlink" href="#pep-241-metadata-in-python-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
    <p>A common complaint from Python users is that there’s no single catalog of all
    the Python modules in existence.  T. Middleton’s Vaults of Parnassus at
    <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vex.net/parnassus/">http://www.vex.net/parnassus/</a> are the largest catalog of Python modules, but
    registering software at the Vaults is optional, and many people don’t bother.</p>
    <p>As a first small step toward fixing the problem, Python software packaged using
    the Distutils <strong class="command">sdist</strong> command will include a file named
    <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">PKG-INFO</span></code> containing information about the package such as its name,
    version, and author (metadata, in cataloguing terminology).  PEP 241 contains
    the full list of fields that can be present in the <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">PKG-INFO</span></code> file.  As
    people began to package their software using Python 2.1, more and more packages
    will include metadata, making it possible to build automated cataloguing systems
    and experiment with them.  With the result experience, perhaps it’ll be possible
    to design a really good catalog and then build support for it into Python 2.2.
    For example, the Distutils <strong class="command">sdist</strong> and <strong class="command">bdist_*</strong> commands
    could support an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">upload</span></code> option that would automatically upload your
    package to a catalog server.</p>
    <p>You can start creating packages containing <code class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">PKG-INFO</span></code> even if you’re not
    using Python 2.1, since a new release of the Distutils will be made for users of
    earlier Python versions.  Version 1.0.2 of the Distutils includes the changes
    described in PEP 241, as well as various bugfixes and enhancements.  It will be
    available from the Distutils SIG at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/distutils-sig/">https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/distutils-sig/</a>.</p>

    seconds since the epoch.  The most common use of these functions is to work with
    the current time, so the floating point argument has been made optional; when a
    value isn’t provided, the current time will be used.  For example, log file
    entries usually need a string containing the current time; in Python 2.1,
    <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">time.asctime()</span></code> can be used, instead of the lengthier

    <p>Authors of C extension modules should test their code with the object allocator
    enabled, because some incorrect code may break, causing core dumps at runtime.
    There are a bunch of memory allocation functions in Python’s C API that have
    previously been just aliases for the C library’s <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">malloc()</span></code> and
    <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">free()</span></code>, meaning that if you accidentally called mismatched functions, the
    error wouldn’t be noticeable.  When the object allocator is enabled, these
    functions aren’t aliases of <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">malloc()</span></code> and <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">free()</span></code> any more, and
    calling the wrong function to free memory will get you a core dump.  For
    example, if memory was allocated using <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">PyMem_New()</span></code>, it has to be freed
    using <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">PyMem_Del()</span></code>, not <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">free()</span></code>.  A few modules included with Python
    fell afoul of this and had to be fixed; doubtless there are more third-party
    modules that will have the same problem.</p>
    <p>The object allocator was contributed by Vladimir Marangozov.</p>

    <li><p class="first">The speed of line-oriented file I/O has been improved because people often
    complain about its lack of speed, and because it’s often been used as a naïve
    benchmark.  The <a class="reference internal" href="../library/readline.html#module-readline" title="readline: GNU readline support for Python. (Unix)"><code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">readline()</span></code></a> method of file objects has therefore been
    rewritten to be much faster.  The exact amount of the speedup will vary from
    platform to platform depending on how slow the C library’s <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">getc()</span></code> was, but
    is around 66%, and potentially much faster on some particular operating systems.
    Tim Peters did much of the benchmarking and coding for this change, motivated by
    a discussion in comp.lang.python.</p>
    <p>A new module and method for file objects was also added, contributed by Jeff
    Epler. The new method, <code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">xreadlines()</span></code>, is similar to the existing
    <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#xrange" title="xrange"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">xrange()</span></code></a> built-in.  <code class="xref py py-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">xreadlines()</span></code> returns an opaque sequence object
    that only supports being iterated over, reading a line on every iteration but
    not reading the entire file into memory as the existing <code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">readlines()</span></code> method
    does. You’d use it like this:</p>
    
    <pre><code class="python">for line in sys.stdin.xreadlines():
    # ... do something for each line ...
    ...</code></pre>

    <p>For a fuller discussion of the line I/O changes, see the python-dev summary for
    January 1–15, 2001 at <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2001-January/">https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2001-January/</a>.</p>

    <li><p class="first">A new method, <code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal"><span class="pre">popitem()</span></code>, was added to dictionaries to enable
    destructively iterating through the contents of a dictionary; this can be faster
    for large dictionaries because there’s no need to construct a list containing
    all the keys or values. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">D.popitem()</span></code> removes a random <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">(key,</span> <span class="pre">value)</span></code> pair
    from the dictionary <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">D</span></code> and returns it as a 2-tuple.  This was implemented
    mostly by Tim Peters and Guido van Rossum, after a suggestion and preliminary
    patch by Moshe Zadka.</p>

    is used, by defining an <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__all__</span></code> attribute containing a list of names that
    will be imported.  One common complaint is that if the module imports other
    modules such as <a class="reference internal" href="../library/sys.html#module-sys" title="sys: Access system-specific parameters and functions."><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">sys</span></code></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="../library/string.html#module-string" title="string: Common string operations."><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal"><span class="pre">string</span></code></a>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">from</span> <span class="pre">module</span> <span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">*</span></code> will add
    them to the importing module’s namespace.  To fix this, simply list the public

    <pre><code class="python"># List public names
__all__ = ['Database', 'open']</code></pre>

    vestigial trace of Python’s C ancestry, but today octal is of very little
    practical use.  Ka-Ping Yee suggested using hex escapes instead of octal ones,
    and using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">\n</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">\t</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">\r</span></code> escapes for the appropriate characters,
